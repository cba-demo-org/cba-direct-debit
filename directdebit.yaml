        Creates an **agreement** which allows the creditor to pull funds from a debtor account. 

        The agreement must first be approved by the debtor party in order to pull funds from their acccount.

        These direct debit **payments** can be on an automated schedule, ad-hoc or one-off. If a recurring schedule is provided, then debits will be automatically created as per the approved schedule.
